\section{VC Dimesion}

\subsection{part a}
VC dimension of H is 3.

It is trivial to show that there exists one or two points on the plane that can be shattered by H. We now show that H is able to shatter 3 points which implies that the VC dimension of H is at least 3.

Select three points with coordinates A(1,1), B(-1,1) and C(-1, -1). There are 8 possible combination of labels which H are able to classify all. The orgin and radius choices are listed as follows for each combination. The order is: label of point A, label of point B, label of point C, origin, radius.
\begin{itemize}
\item +, +, +, (0,0), 2
\item -, -, -, (0,0), 0.5
\item +, -, -, (1,0), 1
\item
\end{itemize}



\subsection{part b}
VC dimension of H is 2k.
