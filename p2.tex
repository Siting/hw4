\subsection{part a}
$\neg{c} = <(c_1,\neg{b_1}), ..., (c_l, \neg{b_l}), \neg{b}>$

\subsection{part b}
First, show k-DNF$\subseteq$k-DL. Since each term of k-DNF can be trasformed into an item of a decision list with value 1, then clearly k-DNF$\subseteq$k-DL.
Next, since we can always find some k-DNF that complements any k-CNF along with the fact that k-DL is closed under complementation (shown in part a), we say that k-CNF$\subseteq$k-DL.
With each component a subset of k-DL, we say there union is also a subset of k-DL denoted as k-DNF $\cup$ k-CNF$\subseteq$k-DL
